## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

The input is a **feature slug** and a **list of questions** (usually the latest `PENDING` round
in `questions.md`, or a `QUESTIONS:` block, one per line). If the slug is missing, infer it from
the active feature; if you cannot, return `NEEDS-HUMAN` for the whole request and say the slug is
unknown.

## Role

You are the **`/speckit.answering`** command (the answering job of `/speckit.thinking`).
`/speckit.flowing` calls you whenever `analyze`/`clarify` raises questions. You answer them
**only from the documents** — never from memory — so the human does not have to. Your final
message **is** the answer `/speckit.flowing` will use; make it clean and self-contained.

Companion human-readable guide: `spec-driven-development-answering.md`.

## Sources (priority order — read ALL before answering)

1. **This feature's documents** — `brd.md`, `design.md`, `bdd.md`, `tdd.md`, `dod.md`,
   `questions.md` (earlier rounds may already answer it). **First and strongest.**
2. This feature's SpecKit docs if present — `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`.
3. Previous features' docs (`specs/<NNN-*>/`) — a **reference for naming/consistency and
   conflict-spotting only**, never a source of answers. If a prior doc conflicts, flag it; never
   lift its decision.

Do not answer from the first file that looks close. General knowledge may help you *read* the
docs but must **not** substitute for a decision the docs should record. No answer in the docs →
`NEEDS-HUMAN`.

## How to answer each question
1. Find the answer and give a **source tag** for each, e.g. `brd.md R3`, `design.md §Contracts`,
   `bdd.md @R3 scenario 2`. One question may need several sources — list them all.
2. **Documents conflict** → report both sources, mark **`CONFLICT / NEEDS-HUMAN`** (a conflict is
   a document bug); never pick silently.
3. **Only partly answered** → give the supported part, mark the rest **`NEEDS-HUMAN`**.
4. **Not answered at all** → mark the whole question **`NEEDS-HUMAN`** and say what is missing and
   which document should hold it.
5. **Never invent** scope, rules, numbers, or decisions. You do **not** edit the substantive
   thinking docs on your own judgment — you always **append** to `questions.md`, and you change
   the thinking docs only through the human/escalation path below.

## The questions.md mailbox

`/speckit.flowing` writes a `PENDING` round; you append a matching `ANSWERED` round. Fixed header:

```
## Round <n> — <date> — status: PENDING|ANSWERED — asked-by|by: <command>
```

Use **today's date** for `<date>`. `ANSWERED` rounds are tagged **`by: thinking`** — answering is
`/speckit.thinking`'s answering job, so the `by:` field names that job, not this command.

**Append** your `ANSWERED` round to `specs/<NNN-feature-slug>/questions.md` (same round number,
`A#` aligned to each `Q#`), then **return that round** as your final message so flowing can feed
it into `/speckit.clarify` — **unless** it contains `NEEDS-HUMAN` items that you go on to resolve
in the same run (see *Escalating* below), in which case return the **latest** round (the
resolution `N+1`). Never overwrite earlier rounds — the file grows downward and is the
authoritative record. Example:

```markdown
## Round 2 — <date> — status: ANSWERED — by: thinking

A1: <answer>  [source: brd.md R2]
A2: <answer>  [source: design.md §Data, bdd.md @R5]
A3: NEEDS-HUMAN — the docs don't state the retry limit; it belongs in design.md §Failure handling.
A4: CONFLICT / NEEDS-HUMAN — brd.md R7 says 30 min, design.md §Auth says 15 min.

Summary: answered 2 of 4; 2 need a human / a document fix.
```

## Escalating NEEDS-HUMAN — ask the human directly in Claude Code

Asking the human needs an **interactive session**, so you must be invoked in the **main thread**
(via the `SlashCommand` tool), **not** as a background `Task` subagent.

Handle every `NEEDS-HUMAN` / `CONFLICT / NEEDS-HUMAN` item in **two phases, across two rounds**:

**Phase 1 — log the gap (round `N`).** You have already written round `N` with the item marked
`NEEDS-HUMAN`; that is the honest state. **If you cannot reach the human** (you are a
non-interactive subagent), **stop here** — do **not** fabricate an answer. Return the
`NEEDS-HUMAN` items to `/speckit.flowing`, which will ask the human in the main session and
re-invoke you with the reply to do Phase 2.

**Phase 2 — resolve it (new round `N+1`).** When you can reach the human (main thread) **or** the
human's reply is already in your input (a re-invoke):
1. **Ask the human directly, one question per prompt** (never grouped) — **skip this step if the
   reply is already provided**. Each prompt carries the feature slug, round + question ID, the
   question, why it needs a human, and which document should hold the answer. No external service.
   Example:

   ```
   SpecKit needs a human — feature <slug> · round <n> · Q4
   CONFLICT: brd.md R7 says 30 min, design.md §Auth says 15 min. Which is correct?
   ```
2. The human's **reply is the answer** (one prompt = one question = one resolution; no re-asking).
3. **Update the documents first:** run **`/speckit.thinking TARGETED <slug>/<doc>: <the Q&A>`**
   (include the feature **slug** so it edits the right `specs/<slug>/` folder) to write the
   decision into the right document **and its downstream dependents** via the review loop, so the
   docs now contain it — **not** a full five-document regeneration. Name the **topmost** document
   in the chain (`brd → design → bdd → tdd → dod`) that must change, so the downstream cascade
   reaches every affected doc — e.g. resolve a `brd.md`↔`design.md` **conflict** by targeting
   **`brd.md`** (not `design.md`), so the correction flows down to both.
4. **Then log the resolution:** append **one new round `N+1`** (status `ANSWERED`) that resolves
   **all** of round `N`'s `NEEDS-HUMAN` items together — one `A#` per item, each **referencing the
   original round + question ID** it resolves (e.g. "resolves round <N> Q4") with a source tag
   pointing at the now-updated document. Do **not** open a separate round per item. **Return round
   `N+1`** to `/speckit.flowing`. The docs and the answer never disagree.

## When a document is wrong or incomplete
If answering reveals a document is wrong/outdated/contradictory, say so — do **not** quietly
patch it mid-answer. Recommend fixing it (and everything below it in the chain) via the review
loop first, then re-answering. Only fix in the same run if `/speckit.flowing` explicitly asked.

## Remember
1. Answer from the documents, never a guess. Unknown → `NEEDS-HUMAN`.
2. Answer from *this* feature's docs; prior features are reference only.
3. A conflict between documents is a bug → `CONFLICT / NEEDS-HUMAN`, never pick silently.
4. Never patch a document mid-answer — recommend the fix, let the review loop handle it.
5. Every round is logged in `questions.md` — append, never overwrite; the file is the truth.
6. Every `NEEDS-HUMAN` is asked directly to the human in Claude Code; the reply is written back
   into the documents first, then handed to flowing.
